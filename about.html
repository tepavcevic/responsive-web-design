      <h2 class="article-title">My name is John, and living the simple life saved my life</h2>

      <p><b>I used to be a pack rat.</b> I had so many thing that I thought I loved, but the truth was I couldn't
        even appreciate any of it, because there was too much.</p>
      <p>Things were terrible. I had a job that I hate, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold
        a relationship.</p>

      <h3>How I turned things around</h3>
      <p><b>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything.</b> I literally put 90% of my opssesions
        in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.</p>
      <p>It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And
        it worked!</p>

      <h3>Now I live a simple life</h3>
      <p>Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more,
        and I have more free time to enjoy.</p>
      <p>With how much it turned my life around, <b>I had no choice but to share how I did it</b>, and how others
        can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!</p>
